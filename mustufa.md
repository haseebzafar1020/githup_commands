# git-demo-again

- step1: created a repo on github account
- step2: created a same name folder in local in your pc.
- step3: create any file in that folder for versioning.
  - eg: `echo "# git-demo-again" >> README.md`
- step4: initialize git in your local folder
  - eg: `git init`
- step5: to check the status (untracked - `red`/track file - `green`) of your github repo
  eg: `git status`
- step6: to move file from untrack fiiles to track files
  - eg: `git add .` OR `git add -A` (add all file into tracking)
  - eg: `git add <file-name>` (add only specific file to tracking)
  - eg: `git add *.csv` (add only specific files)
  - let suppose you want to move file from tracking to untracking again (tick wapis krdo)
    - git `rm --cached <file>`
- step7: to make file ready to to push we do commit (send to airport)
  - eg: `git commit -m "any meaningful comment"`
- step8: to rename the branch from `master` to `main`
  - eg: `git branch -M main`
- step9: to set the origin for your local repo for github repo (travelling destination setting)
  - eg: `git remote add origin https://github.com/aiwithqasim/git-demo-again.git`
- step10: to push file from local to github repo (in lfight from khi to isl)
  - eg: `git push -u origin main`

## second time

- `git add .`
- `git commit -m "any message"`
- `git push`

## Branching

- step01: to check on which branch you're
  - eg: `git branch`
- step02: to move & create new branch
  - eg: `git checkout -b task/development-branch`
  - if branch already exist eg: `git checkout <branch-name>`

## upstraming remote & local branches

- task/development-branch

  - branching code push

- pull request to balance
  main & task/development-branch
  NOTE: pull request always balance git remote branches

- Now if we want to balance LOCAL main & task/development-branch
  - git checkout main
  - git pull ( to take the code from git MAIN branches)
